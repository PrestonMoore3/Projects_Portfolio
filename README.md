# Projects Portfolio
Please view a portfolio of the projects I have completed as a Data Scientist.

On 8/19/2023 I completed the guided project "Create a Cryptocurrency Trading Algorithm" which I completed the required code and analysis for, then added a separate section to put into practice what I learned. Strategies involved were Simple Moving Averages, Crossing Moving Averages, Backtesting, Data Visualization, and Exploratory Data Analysis. The section which is my code based on what I learned starts with "Testing the Algorithm for a Different Time Period."
